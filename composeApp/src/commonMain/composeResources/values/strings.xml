    <string name="bio">I am an Android developer and Engineering Manager at St√∏ (BankID BankAxept). I have been making Android apps for %1$s years, and have been an engineer for %2$s. I like my cats, tv shows, single player story-driven games, and avoiding conversations about hobbies so people don't think I am boring. I dislike billionaires, inequality, and hateful people. I also dislike people who do not release the Epstein files.</string>
